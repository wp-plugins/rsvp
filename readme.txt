Easy to use rsvp plugin originally created for weddings but could be used for other events.

== Description ==

This plugin was initially created for a wedding to make rsvp'ing easy as possible for guests. The main things we found lacking 
in existing plugins was:

* Couldn't relate attendees together so one person could easily rsvp for their whole family
* Required people to remember/know some special knowledge (a code, a zipcode, etc...)

**Please Note** - I don't monitor the forums for issues. If you would like some help or would like to see a new feature please email me at mike AT mde DASH dev.com. I will see what I can do to help.

** If you ever need multiple events that is now available in the pro version of the plugin, found at - http://www.swimordiesoftware.com/downloads/rsvp-pro-plugin/ **

The admin functionality allows you to do the following things:

* Specify the opening and close date to rsvp 
* Specify a custom greeting
* Specify the RSVP yes and no text
* Specify the kids meal verbiage
* Specify the vegetarian meal verbiage 
* Specify the text for the note question
* Enter in a custom thank you
* Create a custom message / greeting for each guest
* Import a guest list from an excel sheet (column #1 is the first name, column #2 is the last name, column #3 associated attendees, column #4 custom greeting)
* Export the guest list
* Add, edit and delete guests
* Associate guests with other guests
* Create custom questions that can be asked by each attendee
* Have questions be asked to all guests or limit the question to specific attendees
* Specify email notifications to happen whenever someone rsvps

If there are any improvements or modifications you would like to see in the plugin please feel free to contact me at (mike AT mde DASH dev.com) and 
I will see if I can get them into the plugin for you.
